## What It Does

Mute.ly is a Chrome extension that transcribes YouTube audio locally with Whisper, for both live streams and VODs.

- **Private by design** — inference runs in-browser via WebAssembly/WebGPU; VOD audio is pulled by a local native process, never a remote server.
- **Zero setup** — no accounts, no API keys, no subscription.
- **Dual-mode** — live audio is captioned just-in-time off voice-activity detection; VODs are transcribed ahead-of-time in chunks as you watch, so seeking never waits on live inference.

---

## Key Features

**Local audio DSP** — every slice is cleaned before it reaches Whisper: a 150Hz Butterworth high-pass biquad strips rumble and hum, and a 20ms-frame noise gate silences background noise that would otherwise get hallucinated into text. A chunk-level RMS gate also short-circuits fully silent 30-second VOD windows before they hit inference.

**Dual transcription pipeline** — live audio is segmented by Silero VAD v5, with each finished utterance (plus a 3s flush for long ones) sent off as it completes. VOD audio is fetched ahead of playback in 30-second chunks on a 25-second stride, keyed by time range so re-seeking never re-transcribes finished work.

**Cinema-style captions** — Whisper output is split on sentence boundaries into ≤42-character, two-line captions with a minimum on-screen duration, so text never flashes faster than it can be read. A dedicated filter also strips Whisper's known phantom-text patterns.

**MV3-safe lifecycle** — a sub-audible 1Hz oscillator keeps the offscreen document alive, and the background worker pings the native host every 20s while streaming, working around Manifest V3's aggressive context suspension. Every message carries a tab/client ID so a stale tab can never write into an active session.

**Seek-aware VOD scheduling** — seeking prunes queued work outside the new playhead, keeps in-flight chunks that are still useful, and aborts/restarts the Whisper worker if the active job no longer matches where playback jumped to.

---

## Architecture

Four isolated MV3 contexts talk only via message passing; a Chrome **native messaging host** (auto-spawned on demand, torn down on disconnect) is the sole source of VOD audio — no local HTTP server involved.

```
[YouTube Tab] <== (Service Worker Relay) ==> [Offscreen Page] <==> [ASR Worker (WebGPU/WASM)]
     ||                                             ||
     || (Live: captureStream + VAD)                 || (VOD: connectNative stdio port)
     \/                                             \/
[Local Audio Output]                        [Native Host: mutely-host.cjs]
                                                    || (yt-dlp | ffmpeg → base64 PCM, seq-numbered frames)
                                                    \/
                                            [YouTube CDN Stream]
```

**Live** — the content script captures tab audio, runs Silero VAD locally, and forwards each finished utterance through the background relay to the offscreen worker for transcription.

**VOD** — the background worker opens a native-messaging port to `mutely-host.cjs`, which pipes `yt-dlp | ffmpeg` back as sequence-numbered, base64 PCM frames; the offscreen document buffers these into an Int16 PCM store and dispatches Whisper jobs for whatever range the playhead needs next, aborting stale jobs on seek.

---

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Chrome 116+, Node.js 18+, and `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg` on PATH.
- macOS: `brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg`
- Linux: `sudo apt install yt-dlp ffmpeg`
- Windows: `winget install yt-dlp` and `winget install ffmpeg`

1. **Build:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Load the extension:** open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, "Load unpacked" → select `dist`, copy the extension ID shown on the card.
3. **Install the native host (one-time):**
   ```bash
   npm run install-host -- --extension-id=<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>
   ```
   Registers `com.mutely.host.json` for your OS's browsers and refuses to install if `yt-dlp`/`ffmpeg` aren't on PATH.
4. **Use it:** open any YouTube video and click the speaker icon in the player controls. Chrome spawns the host process on demand — no terminal, no server to run.

*First run downloads the model (~75MB live / ~140MB VOD) and caches it in IndexedDB for instant startup after.*
